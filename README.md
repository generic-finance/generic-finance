# Generic Finance

“DeFi Summer” brought exciting developments in the form of Yield Farming, with the introduction of Yearn vaults being one of the most important. Projects such as Pickle Finance and Harvest Finance have already built off of the blueprint that Yearn laid out. We believe the DeFi community can benefit from cheap alternatives to these popular vaults, so we are creating alternatives without withdrawal or performance fees, that have no admin keys and 24 hr timelocks. We’re also open to considering other best practices that users would like to see (e.g. multi-sig vaults)

Our vaults build off of the most popular vaults in DeFi, but have not been audited, though we will pursue professional audits if these vaults gain traction and the community wants to fund then (through selling GNR tokens). We are pursuing a token distribution as follows:

30000 GNR tokens. 
Token distribution schedule. 

**Week 1**

YFI, FARM, PICKLE tokens staked in these vaults will earn 

**Week 2**

Deposit in DAI, USDC, TUSD vaults to earn yield from appreciating gDAI, gUSDC, gTUSD as well as GNR tokens.
